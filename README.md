This website is created using the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme.

I have created a set of styles, includes and layouts on top of it to customize it to my liking. It runs on the gem version of Minimal Mistakes
for easy updating! 

To build the site locally:

RUN: `$ bundle install`
RUN: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
