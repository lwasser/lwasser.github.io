## Hey there! Welcome to My Website! :wave:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/87748882.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/87748882)

This repository contains the source for my personal site built with Jekyll using the Minimal Mistakes theme (which i'm slowly breaking away from).  

## Prerequisites (macOS)
- Ruby (compatible with your Gemfile)
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
- Node.js & npm (only required if you build Tailwind locally; Homebrew recommended: `brew install node`)

## Quickstart
1. Fork, clone and create a branch to work on
2. Install Ruby gems using Bundler:

```bash
bundle install
```

3. Serve Jekyll
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:4000 to preview the site.


I have created a set of styles, includes and layouts on top of it to customize it to my liking. It runs on the gem version of Minimal Mistakes
for easy updating! 

To build the site locally:

RUN: `$ bundle install`
RUN: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
