As I have recently made a big job change - leaving academia <link to twitter post or embed it?>
And as such i've been reflecting on some of the work i've done over the past 20 
years. In this post, I wanted to reflect a bit on some lessons learned (so many 
lessons!) from working with Underserved communities.

DISCLAIMER: This post represents my thoughts and experiences. Please know that 
I understand this work is a continued learning process. I've learned frm each project
and look forward to continued learning in the future. I focus most of this discussion
on a recent NSF award from a proposal I wrote in 2019. However the work in that 
project built upon efforts that I previously worked on however are not online 
(it was THAT LONG AGO :) ) 

## About the Earth Data Science Corps

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
## Program Goals

1. Build capacity at schools serving historically underrepresented communities to teach earth and environmental data science to students. 
2. Train undergraduate students at these schools with technical data skills to support their career development.

## Program Components

* Weekly data skills training 
* Student-driven project based learning (internship style)
* Faculty support to add technical data skills elements to their courses

**IMPORTANT:** Students and faculty were financially supported to participate

  The program was significantly modified once we began offering it due to both 
  lessons learned working with the schools and also the COVID-19 pandemic which hit just 
  weeks before we launched and pushed everything into a fully online space.

The Earth and Environmental Data Science Corps (EDSC) was a 1.3 million dollar National 
Science Foundation (NSF) award supporting a proposal. The award supported a 
proposal that I wrote in 2019 working with Jenny Palomino and Lauren Herwehe
at Earth Lab, CU Boulder. 

## Support For Institutions Serving students Traditionally Underrepresented in STEM
The program was designed to support colleges in the United States that 
serve traditionally under-served communities. While there is huge job market 
demand in the earth and environmental data
science field, these smaller schools often do not have the resources to teach 
these skills. There are many often complex reasons for this of few of which are:

1. Lack of faculty and instructors with skills needed to teach earth and environmental data science. 
2. Faculty who might be interested in such skills are often don't have resources to learn them. 
3. Often students are unaware of career paths available to them if they gain these skills; this can be partially caused by a to lack of role models who are pursing such careers. In this case there is low demand for courses that offer these data skills; school thus don't invest in the curriculum. 
4. Lack of institutional funding to develop new programs and curriculum.

These are just a few of the challenges that we grew to better understand as we 
worked with faculty and students...

## Program Components
The program can be broader broken up into two components. 

**The first was providing training to faculty and students in in-job-market demand earth and 
environmental data science skills:** The idea behind our leading the initial training sessions was was that, while we 
were delivering it, it faculty could learn as we taught and slowly begin to 
teach components themselves in their courses. 

**The second was supporting faculty in adding 
earth and environmental data science curriculum to their courses:** This involved
faculty-specific mentoring sessions where they developed curriculum in small groups
that they could teach in their programs. 

We also offered content for them to teach through our open education portal -
earthdatascience.org which had hundreds of lessons available for anyone to use
in any course. We shared workshop content with students and faculty using 
Google Collab - which is freely available and offers easy-to-use computation
for any school.

	<figcaption>Our original program design was a 3-semester program. After 
  working more closely with faculty and considering resource challenges at the 
  schools, we opted to create a summer program to make student and faculty 
  participation easier. Students often seek employment in the summers but are 
  busy during the semester with school, family and often other jobs.</figcaption>

## Program Design
The program as designed in the original proposal was greatly modified during
implementation. 

1. First, because we were pushed into a fully online environment, we went to a go to tool - Zoom to teach content. 
2. Second, students were heavily stressed out given the pandemic which hit under-served groups even harder than others.
  
We modified the program to be a summer program and quickly learned that Zoom is 
not an ideal way to mimic a classic classroom teaching environment. These 
students needed to work in small groups and to have 1:1 interactions with 
faculty to feel supported. We lost students because of this along the way. 

In years two and three we adjusted the program in many ways. Lessons learned
are discussed below.

## Core Lessons Learned From This Program

Working with under-served institutions, students and faculty requires 
tremendous care, time and consideration. We learned a tremendous amount from the 
faculty and students who participated in this program. 

<div class="notice" markdown="1">
### Design & Build the Program With the Participants From the Beginning 
I made the mistake of starting work on the proposal only weeks before it was due.
It was my first NSF proposal and I didn't account for the time needed to truly 
build relationships with our partners and include them in the core design. Because 
of this, I had to redesign the program once we began actual work because it was
important to us that the faculty and students felt invested in the program and 
gained a large return from it.

Lesson learned: Don't try to design a training program without involving the 
students and faculty.
While you might have considerable expertise in teaching, program design, timing of 
activities, how content is delivered may all need to be adjusted depending upon
your target audience.  
</div>
<div class="notice" markdown="1">
### Allow for considerable amount of extra time when working with these communities 

This time is critical to building trust with these communities. Spend time with 
students individually and in small groups. Get to know the issues they are dealing 
with that may get in the way of learning and participation. Accommodate them
in every way possible. This all takes time to do well.  

</div>
<div class="notice" markdown="1">
## Be Flexible to Adapt when things don't work
I am a strong believer in adaptive program design and development. What this means
is develop surveys for participants and collect data often and frequently. Then 
adapt and change based upon their needs and feedback. Finally let them know
when you are making changes and why (because of their helpful feedback). 
This not only improves your program but also helps participants feel more a part
of the entire process rather than feeling "left behind".

</div>
<div class="notice" markdown="1">
### Mentorship and Check-ins Are Critical
Set up a support system for students is critical for project success. This 
support system could be multi-tier. In our case we invited students from 
previous years of the program to mentor in following years. While student can 
look up to their instructors, it's even more powerful to learn from and receive 
support from their peers - particularly if they identify with the background of 
their peers. 

Also ensure that student have structure. Schedule check-ins with faculty and instructors
regularly. 

</div>
<div class="notice" markdown="1">
### Working Online is Hard - Zoom Doesn't Cut It
In year two of the program we moved from Zoom to an interactive online platform
called Spatial Chat<Add link>. I had started using this platform in my 
Earth Data Analytics professional program courses<LILNK> and found it to be a 
great way to recreate the classroom environment where ou can check in with students
individually or small groups. The platform also allows student to work together 
dynamically during class and share screens.  

We all learned a lot during the beginning of the pandemic. But spatial chat 
or something like it, is one tool i'll take with me and use for the forseeable future.

### Make Sure You Have A (Relatively) Fail-Proof Compute Environment
In the early days of teaching earth and environmental data science in our professional
graduate program, I created a 
Jupyter Hub (Many thanks to Tim Head and Karen Cranston for help with that effort!)
that we hosted on Google CLoud for students. What I loved about 
this platform is I was able to skip over troubleshooting student issue with 
their compute environment during class. The platform just worked. However, the 
problem with this environment in a non-paid environment such as our work with the 
faculty at these smaller schools, is they are left without a compute environment
when the program ends.

Because of this we moved all of our programs to Google Collab which allows students 
and faculty to take all of the resources with them. Since we were using Python,
that meant Jupyter Notebooks that were stored in participants Google Drive (now
Google Workspace). This is a huge win for everyone - especially faculty who wish
to adapt these content into their own courses.

## Wrapping This Up
So the above is in a nut shell some things I learned from this program. While
I pointed out a lot of the pain points above, we had some great successes too.
Several of our tribal students went on to Graduate school and were incredible 
mentors and advocates during their time in and after the program. I will never 
forget my time designing and launching this program. All of the amazing people 
I got to know and work with and how much I learned from them all.

## Notes 
Some of the faculty and students that we worked with on this project are 
listed below *(because I left CU and was unable to work on the project as a lead
PI after the departure due to challenges with CU policy, some names are 
missing from this list as leads at each school changed!! These are people whom 
I worked closely with while there)*:

* Elisha Yellow Thunder (A true leader and rock star, Oglala Lakota College)
* Jim Sanovia (Oglala Lakota College)
* David Parr (Metro State University) 
* Jeremy Guinn (United Tribes Technical College - now at NSF)
* Emily Biggane (United Tribes Technical College), 
* Nate Quarderer (CU Boulder,  who ran and taught a significant 
portion of the program in years 2 and 3 ),
* Bill Travis (CU Boulder faculty representative) and 
* All of Earth Lab who created space for the proposal to be written and supported.
