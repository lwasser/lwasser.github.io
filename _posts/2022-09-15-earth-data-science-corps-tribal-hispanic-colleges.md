## Years of experience, but i'm still learning...

Today i'll talk about the Earth and environmental data science corps, a program that I designed with
colleague, Jenny Palomino in 2019. This program which targeted students and faculty at schools that serve communities traditionally underrepresented in STEM was taught fully online.

For me, this program pulled together a solid 15 years of experience 
working on and creating different education programs combined with work
that targeted under-served communities. It was funded by the National Science foundation in September 2019. A large proportion of the funds 
went to faculty and students at partner schools.

*DISCLAIMER: This post represents my thoughts and experiences. Please know that 
work in this space of DEIA requires continued learning. I am continuing to 
learn every day.*

## About the Earth Data Science Corps

The Earth and Environmental Data Science Corps (EDSC) built capacity at schools that serve historically under-represented groups
to teach and to learn open and reproducible earth and environmental data 
science skills. 

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
## The program had several goals

1. Build capacity at schools serving historically underrepresented 
communities to teach earth and environmental data science to students. 
2. Train undergraduate students at these schools with technical data 
skills to support their career development.
3. Increase awareness of job potential in the sciences if you have data science skills

## Components of the program

* Weekly data skills workshops (training)
* Student-driven project based learning (internship style)
* Faculty support to add technical data skills elements to their courses
* Lots of evaluation surrounding both participant satisfaction with the program,
sentiment around belonging to the science community and around learning.

**IMPORTANT:** Students and faculty were financially supported to participate in this program.

  hit just weeks before we launched and pushed everything into a fully online space.

## What is earth and environmental data science?

I define 
earth and environmental data science as skills at the intersection of science and data science including:

* technical data science skills
* the ability to work with different types of data
* communication skills
* collaboration skills
* and finally the ability to create workflows using open reproducible approaches.

	<figcaption>This graphic shows the various elements of earth and environmental data science as I defined it in our program. It includes: The ability to use different types of data, technical data science skills, communication skills and collaboration skills. The entire program is founded in the idea that all workflows should be open and reproducible. Source: This is a graphic I made to support the NSF proposal in 2019.

## Our Partner Institutions

In addition to CU Boulder which was where I was working at the time
and thus our home institution, we had 3 other partner institutions:

### Tribal
* Oglala Lakota College
* United Tribes Technical College

### Hispanic serving
* Metro State University 


## Support For Institutions Serving students Traditionally Underrepresented in STEM
The program was designed to support our partner institutions. While there is huge job market 
demand in the earth and environmental data
science field, these smaller schools often do not have the resources to teach 
these skills. 

### Why don't smaller schools offer earth and environmental data science programs? 

There are many often complex reasons why schools like this do not
always offer data science programs including: 

1. Lack of faculty and instructors with skills needed to teach earth and environmental data science. 
2. Faculty who might be interested in such skills are often don't have resources to learn them.  
3. Lack of institutional funding to develop new programs and curriculum.

### Students don't see themselves as data scientists and thus don't know to pursue such skills

One reason that smaller school often lack programs related to earth and environmental
data science is particularly profound. Often students 
are unaware of career paths available to them if they gain these skills in part 
because they lack of role models that are similar to them. In short many tribal 
students are unaware of career opportunities because they don't see their colleagues
pursuing this path. 

In this case there is low demand for courses that offer these data skills; school 
thus don't invest in the curriculum. Talk about systemic issues and cyclic 
challenges.

These are just a few of the challenges that we grew to better understand as we 
worked with faculty and students. But that last one was the most profound for me 
to learn about. There are so many well-paying jobs for those with domain specific
data science skills.

## Building earth and environmental data science capacity at smaller schools 

Our program goal was to build capacity at these schools to teach earth and environmental data intensive 
science. We also wanted to build awareness of job potential in this space. 

While I think we did the former well, I am not convinced about the latter...
more on that in a bit.

	<figcaption>Capacity building. Our goal was to meet each institution where they were in terms of capacity to teach data skills. We would then build capacity from that starting place to avoid overwhelming faculty.</figcaption>
</figure>

## EDSC program components

Our EDSC program can be broader broken up into three components. 

### 1. Provide training to faculty and students in in-job-market demand earth and 

The idea behind our leading the initial training sessions was was that, while we 
were delivering it, it faculty could learn as we taught and slowly begin to 
teach components themselves in their courses. 

### 2. Supporting faculty in adding earth and environmental data science curriculum to their courses

This involved
faculty-specific mentoring sessions where they developed curriculum in small groups
that they could teach in their programs. 

### 3. Build career awareness 

The third activity involved  actually career awareness webinars. The idea was that we could 
connect students to people in industry and other students who were early career
and pursuing earth and environmental data science related jobs. We quickly learned 
that the impact of these activities wasn't as powerful as we imagined. Why?

Because our panelists often had PhDs. Our panelists came from very different 
backgrounds. It was difficult for our students to connect with those in the 
webinars. I'd design this much differently if I were to do it again. But i'll save this for another blog post...

### Publishing lesson content as open education resources

All of the content used in the program was either already on or published on an 
open education portal that I spent a few years working on to support our professional
graduate program: earthdatascience.org. This portal has has hundreds of lessons 
available for anyone to use in any course. The idea was that if the teaching 
and learning content was online, anyone including faculty from our partner 
schools, could use the content in their courses. 


### Compute environment - JupyterHub
We originally setup a JupyterHub for students to work. A JupyterHub is an online
cloud based environment that provides Jupyter notebooks and memory and processing
resources that you allocate for students to use. The benefit of this was that 
it removed the barrier of a student needing to have a particular type of computer,
and needing to install software on that computer. In fact the Jupyter hub works 
on a tablet or any laptop with internet access.

We had been using this environment for a few years to support our professional 
graduate program and it worked well there. However I quickly realized this was not a good long term solution for this program. 

Why? 

Well we were maintaining it. And there was no way for the schools 
to take the environment home with them to use in their curruclum. 
(they were dependent on us). This platform certainly did not build capacity to 
teach at other schools!  

In the end we moved to Google Colab. I'll share the details of 
compute environments for teaching - specifically as it relates 
to supporting smaller schools in another blog.

## Program Design
The program as designed in the original proposal was greatly modified during
implementation. 

1. First, the program began in April 2020. The COVID 19 pandemic quickly 
pushed us into a fully online environment. We went to a go to tool - Zoom to teach content (more on why this wasn't ideal in a separate blog). 
1. Second, students were heavily stressed out given the pandemic which hit 
under-served groups even harder than others.
  
We modified the program to be a summer program and quickly learned that Zoom is 
not an ideal way to mimic a classic classroom teaching environment. These 
students needed to work in small groups and to have 1:1 interactions with 
faculty to feel supported. We lost a few students in the first year because of 
this.

    <img src="/images/edsc-timeline-activities.png" alt="Timeline showing when each program element would occur starting with the carpentries training, then our training and then an applied internship. The program ultimately looked very different once we actually implemented it but conceptually was this type of design."></a>
	<figcaption>Our original program design was a 3-semester program. After 
  working more closely with faculty and considering resource challenges at the 
  schools, we opted to create a summer program to make student and faculty 
  participation easier. Students often seek employment in the summers but are 
  busy during the semester with school, family and often other jobs.</figcaption>
</figure>

In years two and three we adjusted the program in many ways. Lessons learned
are discussed below.

## Core Lessons Learned From This Program

Working with under-served institutions, students and faculty requires 
care, time and consideration. We learned a tremendous amount from the 
faculty and students who participated in this program. 

<div class="breakout" markdown="1">

### 1. Design & Build the Program With the Participants From the Beginning 
I made the mistake of starting work on the proposal only weeks before it was due.
It was my first NSF proposal and I didn't account for the time needed to truly 
build relationships with our partners and include them in the core design. Because 
of this, I had to redesign the program once we began actual work because it was
important to us that the faculty and students felt invested in the program and 
gained a large return from it.

Lesson learned: Don't try to design a training program without involving the 
students and faculty.
While you might have considerable expertise in teaching, program design, timing of 
activities, how content is delivered may all need to be adjusted depending upon
your target audience.  
</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 2. Allow for considerable amount of extra time when working with these communities 

This time is critical to building trust with these communities. Spend time with 
students individually and in small groups. Get to know the issues they are dealing 
with that may get in the way of learning and participation. Accommodate them
in every way possible. This all takes time to do well.  

</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 3. Be Flexible to Adapt when things don't work
I am a strong believer in adaptive program design and development. What this means
is develop surveys for participants and collect data often and frequently. Then 
adapt and change based upon their needs and feedback. Finally let them know
when you are making changes and why (because of their helpful feedback). 
This not only improves your program but also helps participants feel more a part
of the entire process rather than feeling "left behind".

</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 4. Mentorship and Check-ins Are Critical
Set up a support system for students is critical for project success. This 
support system could be multi-tier. In our case we invited students from 
previous years of the program to mentor in following years. While student can 
look up to their instructors, it's even more powerful to learn from and receive 
support from their peers - particularly if they identify with the background of 
their peers. 

Also ensure that student have structure. Schedule check-ins with faculty and instructors
regularly. 

</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 5. Working Online is Hard - Zoom Doesn't Cut It

When I talk with others about programs that have DEIA goals, 
the immediate response is often "oh, online won't work".

While I do think there is a place for in person interactions.
And they are important. I think that immediate response to online learning
does not take into consideration, one thing:

> teaching online requires a redesign of your curriculum and 
> how you teach. 

I will spend more time talking about this in another blog.
In our case, we had to move our entire program online with a few
weeks notice due to the pandemic. So we learned the hardway what worked and what didn't work.

However, it helped us that in our professional program, I was already 
teaching in a hybrid in person / online setting. Thus I had adapted
a lot of my content to support online participants. 

In year two of the program we moved from Zoom to an interactive online platform
called Spatial Chat. I had started using this platform in my 
Earth Data Analytics professional program courses and found it to be a 
great way to recreate the classroom environment where ou can check in with students
individually or small groups. The platform also allows student to work together 
dynamically during class and share screens.  

We all learned a lot during the beginning of the pandemic. But spatial chat 
or something like it, is one tool i'll take with me and use for the forseeable future. 

</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 6. Make Sure You Have A (Relatively) Fail-Proof Compute Environment
In the early days of teaching earth and environmental data science in our professional
graduate program, I created a 
Jupyter Hub (Many thanks to Tim Head and Karen Cranston for help with that effort!)
that we hosted on Google CLoud for students. What I loved about 
this platform is I was able to skip over troubleshooting student issue with 
their compute environment during class. The platform just worked. However, the 
problem with this environment in a non-paid environment such as our work with the 
faculty at these smaller schools, is they are left without a compute environment
when the program ends.

Because of this we moved all of our programs to Google Collab which allows students 
and faculty to take all of the resources with them. Since we were using Python,
that meant Jupyter Notebooks that were stored in participants Google Drive (now
Google Workspace). This is a huge win for everyone - especially faculty who wish
to adapt these content into their own courses. 
</div>

## Wrapping This Up
So the above is in a nut shell some things I learned from this program. While
I pointed out a lot of the pain points above, we had some great successes too.
Several of our tribal students went on to Graduate school and were incredible 
mentors and advocates during their time in and after the program. I will never 
forget my time designing and launching this program. All of the amazing people 
I got to know and work with and how much I learned from them all.

## Notes 
Some of the faculty and students that we worked with on this project are 
listed below *(because I left CU and was unable to work on the project as a lead
PI after the departure due to challenges with CU policy, some names are 
missing from this list as leads at each school changed!! These are people whom 
I worked closely with while there)*:

* Elisha Yellow Thunder (A true leader and rock star, Oglala Lakota College)
* Jim Sanovia (Oglala Lakota College)
* David Parr (Metro State University) 
* Jeremy Guinn (United Tribes Technical College - now at NSF)
* Emily Biggane (United Tribes Technical College), 
* Nate Quarderer (CU Boulder,  who ran and taught a significant 
portion of the program in years 2 and 3 ),
* Bill Travis (CU Boulder faculty representative) and 
* All of Earth Lab who created space for the proposal to be written and supported.
