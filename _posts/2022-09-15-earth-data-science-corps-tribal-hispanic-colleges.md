## A program to build capacity to teach earth and environmental data science at tribal and hispanic serving schools: the earth and environmental data science corps (EDSC)

In 2019, I wrote an NSF proposal to create a program that supported
students and faculty at schools that serve communities 
traditionally underrepresented in STEM. The program focused on 
supporting hispanic and tribal serving colleges in adding earth and 
environmental data science curriculum to their courses. It also focused 
on training students to be leaders in this space. 

The program was designed as a hybrid in-person / online program. I had been 
teaching in this type of hybrid environment for years, and have found 
this way to teaching to be effective as it can [support student-directed 
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student-directed_teaching), if done well.

This program pulled together a solid 15 years of my experience 
working on and creating different education programs that served a suite
of different audiences including under-served communities. And I was lucky 
enough at the time to be working with a wonderful colleague, Jenny Palomino, who also had deep experience in education and training 
and was excited to help design this program. 

It was my first (and only!) NSF proposal. And it was funded for 3 years. 

This award in my mind was not about funding my team (although that 
was important so we could get the work done). Most of the funding in 
the proposal, went to faculty and students at partner 
schools. Schools that served tribal and hispanic students - two groups
that have been traditionally under-served and underrepresented in both STEM and data science (probably more so underrepresented in data science!). 

We called the program the Earth and Environmental Data Science Corps (EDSC).

  faculty and students at the schools and adapted to meet their needs.

  hit the United States just weeks before we launched the EDSC. This forced our entire program into a fully online environment.

I have to add that I was lucky with this program's design. My ideas, I think were good ones. However, I failed early on in designing it because I didn't leave enough time to include faculty at each school in the program design. I build relationships at the schools. But there was not enough time to let them drive the design.

Luckily the design, and I, were both flexible! So we were able to make massive changes to the program after working with faculty for 6 months and before the program actually started! Phew!

## About the Earth Data Science Corps

The Earth and Environmental Data Science Corps (EDSC) built capacity to teach and to learn open and reproducible earth and environmental data 
science skills at schools that serve historically under-represented groups in STEM. 

### The program had several goals
 
2. Train undergraduate students with technical data 
skills needed to support a strong career in data-intensive science.
3. Increase awareness of job potential in the data-intensive science space. This supported students "seeing" a career path potential that could be empowered by technical data science skills.
3. Support and empower faculty in adding data-intensive curriculum into their existing courses. This would then scale data skills being available at each institution rather than depending upon our team to teach. This goal was critical. This goal was the element that would scale the effort empower others. 

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
**IMPORTANT:** Students and faculty were financially supported to participate in this program. It is critical in any effort focused 
on under-served communities to make sure their participation is 
supported. People in these communities are already over taxed for 
so many different reasons. Staff time was of course also covered. 
**Participant time was simply prioritized.** 
</div>

### Components of the program

The program components included: 

A student paid summer internship that was comprised of:
* Weekly data skills workshops
* Student-driven project based learning (internship style) to reinforce skills through application. 
* Peer to peer mentorship where students from the previous years would return as a mentor/intern that would mentor students in the current cohort.

Faculty support to:
* Add add technical data skills elements to their courses (train the trainer)
 
And: 
* Lots of evaluation surrounding both participant satisfaction with the program,
sentiment around belonging to the science community and around learning.


Evaluation was a critical part of this work (and the entire program that 
I build at CU Boulder. As such i'll talk about 
it separately in another blog post. I will also talk more specifically about the elements of this program in a separately. Each of the above elements were carefully designed with this 
audience in mind. 
{: .notice }

## What is earth and environmental data science?

It's important to place this program in the context of the field of 
earth and environmental data science. I define earth and environmental data 
science as skills at the intersection of open science and data science 
including:

* technical data science skills
* the ability to work with different types of data
* communication skills
* collaboration skills
* and finally the ability to create workflows using open reproducible approaches. 

These skills are critical because there is a huge job-market demand for 
them today. Traditional data science skills are useful. But understanding
how to apply those skills is even more in-demand. Further, as science and 
industry becomes increasingly collaborative, and interdisciplinary there is a demand for people
who can communicate and collaborate in diverse group settings. 

All of those skills are what makes up the field of earth and environmental 
data science.

    <img src="/images/blog/what-is-earth-environmental-data-science.png" alt="An image showing green blocks with the 5 components of earth data science including domain science, communication and collaboration, data skills, using diverse data types and reproducible workflows. "></a>
	<figcaption>This is a graphic that I made showing the various elements of earth and environmental data science as I defined it in our program. It includes: The ability to use different types of data, technical data science skills, communication skills and collaboration skills. The entire program is founded in the idea that all workflows should be open and reproducible. 
  </figcaption>
</figure> 

I started teaching earth and environmental data science skills (minus the open reproducible elements) in my first science related job at Penn State; and they were core to the 
program that I built at NEON to support ecologists using NEON data. 
{: .notice }

## Our Partner Institutions

In addition to CU Boulder, we had 3 other partner institutions (actually 4 but one had to drop out after year 1):

### Tribal colleges 
* [Oglala Lakota College](https://www.olc.edu/)
* [United Tribes Technical College](https://uttc.edu/)

### Hispanic serving
* [Metro State University](https://www.msudenver.edu)

## If there is a job market for these skills, why aren't smaller schools teaching earth and environmental data science already?  

You may be wondering: if there is such a demand for these schools, why 
aren't all schools, big and small, well-funded and lesson funded, teaching 
them to their students? 

The answer to that is - it's complicated :). Even at larger universities, most 
have traditionally taught data science in isolation from science skills(atleast this was the case in at the time).  Or perhaps they teach 
the skills together but don't talk about reproducibility, and communication and collaboration skills. 

And at smaller schools courses offering these skill were even more scarce. 

There are many, often complex, reasons for this including: 

1. Lack of faculty and instructors with skills needed to teach earth and environmental data science. 
2. Faculty who might be interested in teaching these skills, often don't have resources to learn them.  
3. Faculty that have the skills don't necessarily have the time to modify curriculum.
3. Lack of institutional funding to develop new programs and curriculum.

### Plan a: Give schools a course that's ready to teach (spoiler: this didn't work)
Originally when starting this program, my vision was that we could provide 
schools with a well designed entry-level earth and environmental data science focused 
course and curriculum that they could just teach at their school. 

This idea was extremely naive. Add a new course to the catalog of offerings at these schools
was a massive undertaking. Even when provided with the curriculum! 

* the course needed needed to fit into existing curriculum
* they needed someone with skills that could teach the content year after year 
* finally, and most importantly there needed to be enough students at the school who wanted to take such courses, to warrant resources for such a curriculum!  

### Students don't see themselves as data scientists and thus don't know to pursue such skills

I was surprised at the time that student demand for technical data 
science programs at some schools also drove the curriculum gap.

I didn't consider that if a population of people are not represented in 
a particular field, they may not see themselves as being able to pursue careers in that space. They may 
not even want to be a part of that space.  

>  Seeing yourself as a potential part of a community matters

In short, often students 
are unaware of career paths available to them. So, they don't consider
pursuing data science as their peers and role models aren't pursuing data science.  

This was especially the case at the tribal colleges. No demand, no courses or investment from the schools.

Yes, we are talking here about how 
systemic racism actually impacts demand for curriculum that could have 
huge job potential. 

### Having a sense of belonging matters as does confidence 

To me, the systemic nature of this issue was the most profound. In 
working with many students from diverse backgrounds, I have found that 
many often don't think they are capable of coding.

Frankly, I was one of those many years ago and I have the inherent systemic 
"privilege", that comes with being a white, american female! I lacked confidence. I had imposter syndrome. I still do carry soem of that with me in my daily work. 

I've seen this a lot in my teaching. 

Lack of confidence also tends to be more common with women compared to men. 
{: .notice--success }

But, there are so many well-paying 
jobs for those with domain specific data science skills!! And I knew that these
students in our program were capable. They just needed to be empowered in 
different ways. And they needed support to commit to the process.  

## Building earth and environmental data science capacity at smaller schools 

Back to the EDSC, our program goal was to build capacity at these 
schools to teach earth and environmental data intensive 
science. We also wanted to build student awareness of job potential in this space. 

While I think we did the former well, I am not convinced about the latter...
more on that in a bit.

    <img src="/images/edsc-data-science-capability.png" alt="Graphic showing how we designed the program to be adaptive and meet institutions at their current data science teaching capacity and then build from there."></a>
	<figcaption>Capacity building. Our goal was to meet each institution where they were in terms of capacity to teach data skills. We would then build capacity from that starting place to avoid overwhelming faculty.</figcaption>
</figure>

## How The Earth Data Science Corps (EDSC) worked

Our EDSC program was broken up into three sub-programs. 

### Program 1. Provide earth and environmental data science training to faculty and students

We lead initial workshops. The idea here 
was that faculty could learn in year 1 from our training. And then in 
years 2 and 3, they could slowly build skills to teach some of the 
curriculum (with our support!). The ultimate goal was that this 
experience would help faculty build skills and confidence to teach this content in their courses.

This program worked on some levels. While faculty never ended up leading
the workshops, they did end up setting up work sessions with the students. 
And through helping in those session they built confidence and skills. 

Some direct thoughts from participants are below

> I am taking away some more confidence with python and data science as my department is moving into this direction. As for our tribal enrolled students and their projects, it was good to see that they were able to show the importance of doing a practical verse theoretical summer project.

### Program 2. Supporting faculty in adding earth and environmental data science curriculum to their courses

This involved
faculty-specific mentoring sessions where they developed curriculum in small groups
that they could teach in their programs. We provided a lot of curriculum 
through our online textbooks on [https://www.earthdatascience.org.](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/).


> I aim to build on the data science and coding skills I learned this summer and implement them into my research program at my institution.

And we also provided Jupyter notebooks through Google Colab (in year two) that served as resources 
to support teaching. 

### Program 3. Build career awareness 

The third activity involved career awareness webinars. The idea was to connect students to people in both industry and academia who were early career
and pursuing earth and environmental data science related careers. 

This worked for some who said things like: 

> It was a great sampling of people who have found their way into the field of EDSci, including someone who does freelance database management, which I hadn’t even considered as a possibility. Eye opening.

However for others it was not enough. Our panelists often had PhDs. Our panelists came from very different 
backgrounds. However, none were tribal. Nor hispanic. There were women, and women of color. But, it was difficult for some students to connect with those in the 
webinars. 

**Why? Because students didn't see themselves in the panelists! (Note that common theme!)**

> Finally for job hunting the guest should not all have PhDs and having a person who actually had
> some difficulty <finding a job> would round the guest out better as well.

There was a certain level of privilege that is associated with getting a Ph.D.
For these students getting an undergraduate degree was a big deal! 

I didn't think about that. And as such our students felt disconnected and didn't 
see themselves in the panelists. 

I can admit it, while parts of year 1 were great, that part was not quite as 
successful as it could have been. Lucky for us we had two more years 
after that first round of activities to try again! 

## The importance of evaluation and adaptive program design

Evaluation and adaptive program design is critical for any program's success. It is particularly important for programs serving groups
that have been traditionally under-represented and underserved. And the quotes above were obtained because of consistent surveys that were filled out after each training informally (using mentimeter) and formally using Qualtrics. 

Even though I entered into this program design with years of experience,
there was (and will always be) a lotto learn. I took notes. 
Lots of notes. 

And we improved both iteratively in year one on the fly, as we could. We 
also modified the program year-to-year. This is how all diversity 
focused programs need to run.

Be flexible.

Adapt to your audience. 

These programs need to adapt through constant learning and asking questions. 

I'd design this program much differently if I were to do it again. But 
I'll save that topic for another blog post...

## Wrapping up part 1 of a blog series on working with tribal and hispanic-serving colleges

This is part one of a series of posts on the earth and environmental 
data science corps program. In part two,
I'll share some more details about the program's core design, with a 
focus on the infrastructure
that we used to support the program.

I'll talk about what worked, and what didn't work. 
And i'll cover some core lessons learned. 

Stay tuned for more...

# Stop here??

### Publishing lesson content as open education resources

All of the content used in the program was either already published on on the earthdatascience.org website. I had I spent a few years designing and building this website to support our professional
graduate program.

This portal had hundreds of lessons focused on earth and environmental 
data science skills. I had hoped that if we published all of the EDSC program materials online, that others could benefit from them. 

That the program could then, at some levels, scale to hundreds and thousands of people.

## An online environment where students and faculty could code

One of the biggest challenges when teaching beginners to code is 
environment setup. This challenge is particularly large if you are using 
Python as your choice programming language. [Python environments are notoriously tricky to setup.](/why-tested-python-environments-matter-for-science). Further, we couldn't 
expect every student to have a computer that they could use to program on! 

I had already built a JupyterHub to [support the professional 
graduate program that I designed and was teaching at the time](https://www.colorado.edu/geography/earth-data-analytics-foundations-professional-certificate). So, I thought we could use that 
same hub to support our students and faculty. 

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
### What is a JupyterHub?
 A [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) is an online
cloud based environment that provides Jupyter notebooks and memory and processing
resources that you allocate for students to use. The benefit of this was that 
it removed the barrier of a student needing to have a particular type of computer,
and needing to install software on that computer. In fact the Jupyter hub works 
on a tablet or any laptop with internet access.
</div>

I quickly realized that the JupyterHub was not a good long term solution for this EDSC program that served small schools with less resources. 

Why? 

We were maintaining it. And it wasn't easy or cheap to maintain outside of a funded program. 

Simply put, students and faculty couldn't take the JupyterHub home with them. 

This meant that faculty couldn't easily add this curriculum to their courses without first knowing how to 

1. setup python environments and 
2. support environment issues that students would inevitably have. 

They were dependent on us. Our JupyterHub was no a solution for 
empowering. Nor could it be used to build capacity to teach at other 
schools! Not being able to take the hub home with them was even frustrating 
for our professional students!

### A truly cloud based portable solution - Google Colab. 

To resolve the issues above, I started to explore using Google Colab.  [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a Google solution. It allows you to launch Jupyter Notebooks from within Google Drive. You can even store data on drive and access it in these notebooks. 

And you can install Python tools too. 

I'll share the details of 
compute environments for teaching - specifically as it relates 
to supporting smaller schools in another blog. But Google Colab was a winning solution for this program and our professional program. More on that coming in the future!

## Earth and Environmental Data Science Corps program design

In the end - after working closely with faculty, we modified the 
entire program design to meet the needs of all involved. But also we were
hit with another surprise - 

Hello Pandemic! 


<figure>
	<a href="/images/blog/covid-meme-zoom-meetings.png" style="width:120%">
    <img src="/images/blog/covid-meme-zoom-meetings.png" alt=""></a>
	<figcaption> The COVID-19 pandemic official hit the United States in March 2020. Our program started at the end of April 2020. Let #ZoomLife and quarantine begin. <a href="https://static.thehoneycombers.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/Funny-Coronavirus-Memes-2.png">src</a></figcaption>
</figure>

1. First, the program began in April 2020. The COVID 19 pandemic forced our hybrid-design program that I had researched and collected data on and improved for  several years, into a fully online environment. Given it was a quick change, I went to the tool I knew best - Zoom to teach content. SPOILER ALERT: Zoom was not good enough! More on why this wasn't ideal in a separate blog. Hybrid teaching CAN work if done well using the right tools and right design.  
1. Second, all students were stressed given the pandemic. Underserved and underrepresented groups were hit EVEN HARDER. None of us were prepared. 

I was also stressed; as was my team! 
  
### Adaptive program development: modifying your programs as you go
We modified the program to be a summer program and quickly learned that Zoom is 
not an ideal way to mimic a classic classroom teaching environment. These 
students needed to work in small groups and to have 1:1 interactions with 
faculty to feel supported. We lost a few students in the first year because of 
this.

<figure>
	<a href="/images/edsc-timeline-activities.png">
    <img src="/images/edsc-timeline-activities.png" alt="Timeline showing when each program element would occur starting with the carpentries training, then our training and then an applied internship. The program ultimately looked very different once we actually implemented it but conceptually was this type of design."></a>
	<figcaption>Our original program design was a 3-semester program. After 
  working more closely with faculty and considering resource challenges at the 
  schools, we opted to create a summer program to make student and faculty 
  participation easier. Students often seek employment in the summers but are 
  busy during the semester with school, family and often other jobs.</figcaption>
</figure>

In years two and three we adjusted the program in many ways. Lessons learned
are discussed below.

## Core Lessons Learned From This Program

Working with under-served institutions, students and faculty requires 
care, time and consideration. We learned a tremendous amount from the 
faculty and students who participated in this program. 

<div class="breakout" markdown="1">

### 1. Design & Build the Program With the Participants From the Beginning 
I made the mistake of starting work on the proposal only weeks before it was due.
It was my first NSF proposal and I didn't account for the time needed to truly 
build relationships with our partners and include them in the core design. Because 
of this, I had to redesign the program once we began actual work because it was
important to us that the faculty and students felt invested in the program and 
gained a large return from it.

Lesson learned: Don't try to design a training program without involving the 
students and faculty.
While you might have considerable expertise in teaching, program design, timing of 
activities, how content is delivered may all need to be adjusted depending upon
your target audience.  
</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 2. Allow for considerable amount of extra time when working with these communities 

This time is critical to building trust with these communities. Spend time with 
students individually and in small groups. Get to know the issues they are dealing 
with that may get in the way of learning and participation. Accommodate them
in every way possible. This all takes time to do well.  

</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 3. Be Flexible to Adapt when things don't work
I am a strong believer in adaptive program design and development. What this means
is develop surveys for participants and collect data often and frequently. Then 
adapt and change based upon their needs and feedback. Finally let them know
when you are making changes and why (because of their helpful feedback). 
This not only improves your program but also helps participants feel more a part
of the entire process rather than feeling "left behind".

</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 4. Mentorship and Check-ins Are Critical
Set up a support system for students is critical for project success. This 
support system could be multi-tier. In our case we invited students from 
previous years of the program to mentor in following years. While student can 
look up to their instructors, it's even more powerful to learn from and receive 
support from their peers - particularly if they identify with the background of 
their peers. 

Also ensure that student have structure. Schedule check-ins with faculty and instructors
regularly. 

</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 5. Working Online is Hard - Zoom Doesn't Cut It

When I talk with others about programs that have DEIA goals, 
the immediate response is often "oh, online won't work".

While I do think there is a place for in person interactions.
And they are important. I think that immediate response to online learning
does not take into consideration, one thing:

> teaching online requires a redesign of your curriculum and 
> how you teach. 

I will spend more time talking about this in another blog.
In our case, we had to move our entire program online with a few
weeks notice due to the pandemic. So we learned the hardway what worked and what didn't work.

However, it helped us that in our professional program, I was already 
teaching in a hybrid in person / online setting. Thus I had adapted
a lot of my content to support online participants. 

In year two of the program we moved from Zoom to an interactive online platform
called Spatial Chat. I had started using this platform in my 
Earth Data Analytics professional program courses and found it to be a 
great way to recreate the classroom environment where ou can check in with students
individually or small groups. The platform also allows student to work together 
dynamically during class and share screens.  

We all learned a lot during the beginning of the pandemic. But spatial chat 
or something like it, is one tool i'll take with me and use for the forseeable future. 

</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 6. Make Sure You Have A (Relatively) Fail-Proof Compute Environment
In the early days of teaching earth and environmental data science in our professional
graduate program, I created a 
Jupyter Hub (Many thanks to Tim Head and Karen Cranston for help with that effort!)
that we hosted on Google CLoud for students. What I loved about 
this platform is I was able to skip over troubleshooting student issue with 
their compute environment during class. The platform just worked. However, the 
problem with this environment in a non-paid environment such as our work with the 
faculty at these smaller schools, is they are left without a compute environment
when the program ends.

Because of this we moved all of our programs to Google Collab which allows students 
and faculty to take all of the resources with them. Since we were using Python,
that meant Jupyter Notebooks that were stored in participants Google Drive (now
Google Workspace). This is a huge win for everyone - especially faculty who wish
to adapt these content into their own courses. 
</div>

## Wrapping This Up
So the above is in a nut shell some things I learned from this program. While
I pointed out a lot of the pain points above, we had some great successes too.
Several of our tribal students went on to Graduate school and were incredible 
mentors and advocates during their time in and after the program. I will never 
forget my time designing and launching this program. All of the amazing people 
I got to know and work with and how much I learned from them all.

## Notes 
Some of the faculty and students that we worked with on this project are 
listed below *(because I left CU and was unable to work on the project as a lead
PI after the departure due to challenges with CU policy, some names are 
missing from this list as leads at each school changed!! These are people whom 
I worked closely with while there)*:

* Elisha Yellow Thunder (A true leader and rock star, Oglala Lakota College)
* Jim Sanovia (Oglala Lakota College)
* David Parr (Metro State University) 
* Jeremy Guinn (United Tribes Technical College - now at NSF)
* Emily Biggane (United Tribes Technical College), 
* Nate Quarderer (CU Boulder,  who ran and taught a significant 
portion of the program in years 2 and 3 ),
