## Building earth and environmental data science capacity at tribal and hispanic serving schools - post 2

[In a previous blog, I introduced a program that I developed in 2019 
called the Earth and Environmental Data Science Corps.](training-diverse-communities-earth-data-science-corps) This program
targeted students and faculty at tribal and hispanic serving 
institutions. It's goal was to build capacity for faculty to teach and
for students to learn earth and environmental data science at these 
institutions (and beyond).

In that blog I talked about:

* What earth and environmental data science is (and why it's important), 
* The various program components that drove the earth and environmental data science corps
* I broadly discussed what elements worked and which ones 
could be improved
* The importance of evaluation and adaptive program development and design. 

Here, i'll discuss how we delivered the program amidst the COVID 19 pandemic and infrastructure that we used in the program. I'll wrap up 
with lessons 
learned. 

I hope that these posts are useful to others building programs in 
this space. I'm using what I learned here as I develop the diversity 
components of [pyOpenSci (my current Python open source software project 
that also supports open science!](https://www.pyopensci.org/)

## Earth and Environmental Data Science Corps program design

Previously, I mentioned the importance of being comfortable with 
adaptive program development. Adaptive program development is 
driven by evaluation and data collection. It assumes that your 
first design is not the final design. 

You check in with participants to see how things are going. And you 
make modifications as you go. I've always taught this way. You can build 
an amazing amount of trust with students if they know that you are listening 
to them and trying to address their needs (within reason). 

This same approach was implemented in the earth and environmental data 
science corps (EDSC).

My original design - the one I developed with Jenny, was great. However, 
after working closely with faculty, we modified the 
entire program design to meet the needs of all involved. for instance, our fall/spring 
semester program turned into a summer program. Students had more time 
in the summer and fewer demands outside of the school year. Many 
of these students had family to support. Thus, a paid summer internship
was appealing and more accessible than during the school year.

The program ultimately looked very different once we actually implemented it but conceptually was this type of design."></a>
	<figcaption>Our original program design was a 3-semester program. After 
  working more closely with faculty and considering resource challenges at the 
  schools, we opted to create a summer program to make student and faculty 
  participation easier. Students often seek employment in the summers but are 
  busy during the semester with school, family and often other jobs.</figcaption>

But also we were hit with another *surprise* - 

Hello Pandemic! 


<figure>

	<figcaption> The COVID-19 pandemic official hit the United States in March 2020. Our program started at the end of April 2020. Let #ZoomLife and quarantine begin. <a href="https://static.thehoneycombers.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/Funny-Coronavirus-Memes-2.png">src</a></figcaption>
</figure>

First, the program began in April 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to move the hybrid teaching model that I had researched and collected data on for several years, into a fully online environment. Literally over night! 

Given it was a quick change, I went to the tool I knew best - Zoom to teach content. 

SPOILER ALERT: Zoom was not good enough! More on why this wasn't ideal in a separate blog. 

Hybrid teaching CAN work if done well using the right tools and right design. 

Second, our students were stressed given the pandemic. Underserved and 
underrepresented groups were hit EVEN HARDER than many of us. None of us 
were prepared. My heart went out to everyone there. 

But, I was also stressed; as was my team! 

  
### Adaptive program development: modifying your programs as you go
We quickly learned that Zoom is 
not an ideal way to mimic a classic classroom teaching environment.  
Students need to work in small groups to be empowered. And faculty need to have 1:1 interactions students to make them supported but also to 
keep tabs on student.

Some students stopped participating and it took us weeks to realize that was happening. Others were there every day but shy about asking for 
help in a large zoom call or in breakout rooms (understandably).

We had some successes in the first year but I knew that we needed to 
modify our approach. 

### Interactive online teaching platforms
During that year I started experimenting with other tools in my courses 
that allowed for more personalized online interactions. 

I started using spatial chat with my professional students each week - for both teaching and office hours. And they really enjoyed it (see quote below from one student). 

> The spatial chat option was nice for one-on-one meeting time with the instructor. Whether or not you decide to stick with spatial chat specifically...


Spatial chat mimicked a more natural teaching environment. 
Students can move themselves around in the online space, work together and not hear other groups. Or they can chose to work alone. 

They can also share screens.

Spatial chat allowed me to checkin 
individually with every student who needed help each week. 

I will save the details of this teaching approach for another blog, but 
we ended up using this approach with some success in the EDSC program. 

Thank goodness for technology!

## Democratizing access to earth and environmental data science skills through open education 

Lucky for us we had already committed to posting all of our lessons 
online as open education resources. This approach was also a way to 
handle the pandemic stress as it allowed students (and faculty) to work at their own 
pace outside of workshop sessions. Many of our students and faculty had families who were 
now at home full time.

I had I spent a few years designing and building this website to support 
our professional graduate program. This portal had hundreds of lessons focused on earth and environmental 
data science skills. I had hoped that if we published all of the EDSC 
program materials online, that others could benefit from them. 

In the context of the EDSC these lessons were also available for faculty to use in their own courses. 

The resources for th EDSC built
on top of existing resources. [Specifically we built out the introductory lessons](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/file-formats/) in our 
intro to earth data science textbook to support the EDSC. 

These lessons covered introductory 
concepts related to working with tabular (spreadsheets) data in pandas, 
time series, and the basics of spatial data manipulation in Python. 

Note: the earthdatascience.org website is not currently under active maintenance. 
{: .notice--info }

Through open education, the program could scale, reaching hundreds 
if not thousands of people around the world.  

[<i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Read more about publishing high quality open education materials here](open-education-data-science-posting-online-is-not-enough) 
{: .btn .btn--info }

But something was still missing. Students and faculty needed somewhere 
to work on the lessons. A place where they could install Python 
packages and run code. 

## An online environment where students and faculty could code

One of the biggest challenges when teaching beginners to code is 
environment setup. This challenge is particularly large if you are using 
Python as your choice programming language. [Python environments are 
notoriously tricky to setup.](/why-tested-python-environments-matter-for-science). Further, we couldn't 
expect every student to have a computer that they could use to write and 
run code. 

I had already built a JupyterHub to [support the professional 
graduate program that I designed and was teaching at the time](https://www.colorado.edu/geography/earth-data-analytics-foundations-professional-certificate). And I had a [tested Python environment that we used to run the hub backend](https://github.com/lwasser/earth-analytics-python-env). So, I thought we could use that 
same hub to support our earth and environmental data science students and faculty. 

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
### What is a JupyterHub?
 A [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) is an online
cloud based environment that provides Jupyter notebooks and memory and processing
resources that you allocate for students to use. The benefit of a 
JupyterHub for teaching is:

* it removed the barrier of a student needing to have a particular type of computer
* it removes the need to install specific tools on a computer. 
* it can be run from any device with internet - including a tablet! 

</div>

### JupyterHub is a great platform but wasn't the right fit for this program
After the first year of the program, I realized that the JupyterHub was 
not a good long term solution for this EDSC program that served small schools with less resources. 

Why? 

We were maintaining it. Mostly I was maintaining it with amazing support 
from my colleague Karen. And it wasn't easy or cheap to maintain outside 
of a funded program. And when it broke, it was stressful for me as a 
teaching. And for the students. 

But also, students and faculty wanted to continue to use the hub after 
our summer program ended. And they couldn't because I couldn't afford to 
maintain it!  

This meant that faculty couldn't easily add this curriculum to their courses without first knowing how to 

1. setup python environments and 
2. support environment issues that students would inevitably have. 

All of our earth and environmental data science participants were thus dependent on us. This platform was not a means towards capacity building!

### A truly cloud based portable solution - Google Colab. 

To resolve the issues above, I started to use Google Colab. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) allows you to launch Jupyter Notebooks - from within Google Drive. You can even store data on drive and access it in these notebooks. 

And you can install Python tools there too. 

Google Colab was a winning solution for this program. And I ended up 
also using it in our professional program for the same reasons. 

## Putting all of the elements together

In the end, our EDSC program looked something like this:

* We kicked the program off with online workshops using Spatial chat as a preferred tool
* Students coded together using Google Collab. All data were stored on Google drive. This allowed students and faculty to take the coding platform with them after the program ended!
* Faculty, rather than teaching each day, mentored the students. In mentoring they further developed their coding skills!
* In year two, students from year one were paid to come back as peer mentors. This was a powerful way to build community and sense of belonging.
* Faculty received training too - empowering them to add content to their existing courses. 
* Students engaged in real-world applied projects as a way to apply their skills. 
* All participants were paid for their time spent both in training, mentoring and project work. 

All in all I think the program had some great successes. For one, several of the
students did go on to graduate school after the program!

And I have been lucky enough to stay in touch with a few of them as well.

I learned a lot from the EDSC participants. Below I share a few of 
the core takeaways that have stuck with me the most. 

## Core Lessons Learned From This Program

Working with under-served institutions, students and faculty requires 
care, time and consideration. We learned a tremendous amount from the 
faculty and students who participated in this program. 

<div class="breakout" markdown="1">

### 1. Design & Build the Program With the Participants From the Beginning 
I made the mistake of starting work on the proposal only weeks before it was due.
It was my first NSF proposal and I didn't account for the time needed to truly 
build relationships with our partners and include them in the core design. Because 
of this, I had to redesign the program once we began actual work. It was
important to us that the faculty and students felt invested in the program and 
gained a large return from it.

Lesson learned: Don't try to design a training program involving 
these communities without involving the 
students and faculty from the very beginning.
While you might have considerable expertise in teaching, program design, 
and timing of activities... and you may have experience working in the 
diversity equity Inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) space, each group 
has individual needs. How content is delivered may all need to be 
adjusted depending upon your target audience.  
</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 2. Allow for a considerable amount of extra time when working with these communities 

Time is critical to building trust with underserved communities. Spend 
extra time with students individually and in small groups. Get to know 
the issues they are dealing with that may get in the way of learning and 
participation. Accommodate these challenges in every way possible. This 
all takes time to do well. 

Trust is critical. 

</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 3. Be Flexible to Adapt when things don't work
I am a strong believer in adaptive program design and development. What this means
is develop surveys for participants and collect data often and frequently. Then 
adapt and change based upon their needs and feedback. Finally participants
know when you are making changes and why (because of their helpful feedback). 

This not only improves your program but also helps participants feel 
more a part
of the entire process rather than feeling "left behind".

It also builds trust and respect. It enforces that you are there to 
help and support their needs. This, in my opinion, holds true in all 
higher education and training spaces. 

</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 4. Mentorship and Check-ins Are Critical
Setting up a support system for students is critical for project success. This 
support system could be multi-tier. In our case we invited students from 
previous years of the program to mentor in following years. While students can 
look up to their instructors, it's even more powerful to learn from and receive 
support from their peers. This is particularly powerful if they identify with the background of 
their peers. And there aren't many of their peers in that professional space to begin with. 

Also ensure that students have structure. Schedule check-ins with 
faculty and instructors regularly. Make sure it is noticed, if a student
doesn't show up one day. Ensure that each student is seen. 

</div>
<div class="breakout" markdown="1">
### 5. Working Online is Hard - Zoom Doesn't Cut It

When I talk with others about programs that have DEIA goals, 
the immediate response is often "oh, online approaches won't work".

While I do think there is a place for in-person interactions. I
also think that immediate response to online learning
does not take into consideration, one thing:

> teaching online requires a redesign of your curriculum and 
> how you teach / deliver content. 

I will spend more time talking about this in another blog.
In our case, we had to move our entire program online with a few
weeks notice due to the pandemic. So we learned the hard way what worked 
and what didn't work.

However, it helped us that in our professional program, I was already 
teaching in a hybrid in person / online setting. Thus, I had adapted
a lot of my content to support online participants. 

In year two of the program we moved from Zoom to an interactive online 
platform called Spatial Chat. I had started using this platform in my 
courses and found it to be a 
great way to recreate the classroom environment where you can check in with students
individually or small groups. The platform also allowed student to work together 
dynamically during class and share screens. 

This approach worked. Students were happy. And students learned a lot!
In short online learning can work well, if you work hard to recreate 
a healthy classroom environment.

### 6. Make Sure You Have A (Relatively) Fail-Proof Compute Environment
In the early days of teaching earth and environmental data science in our professional
graduate program, I created a 
Jupyter Hub (Many thanks to Tim Head and Karen Cranston for help with that effort!). What I loved about 
this platform was the ability to skip over troubleshooting student environment issues on their local computers during class. 

However, the 
problem with the JupyterHub was that it wasn't portable. Students couldn't take it home with them. Faculty couldn't use it in their classes
the following year. This was because it was hard for me to maintain (there were costs!).

Google Colab is a free tool can be used from within Google Drive. 
These platforms are available to students at no cost. This allowed 
students and faculty to take all of the resources with them. 

Since we were using Python,
that meant Jupyter Notebooks that were stored in participants Google Drive (now
Google Workspace). This was a huge win for everyone - especially faculty who waned
to adapt the content into their own courses. 
</div>

## Wrapping This Up
The above is a summary of a program that had many pieces. I shared some of what I learned and some of the pain points that we experienced when 
running the program. 

As I mentioned we had some great successes too.
Several of our tribal students went on to Graduate school. Several returned in following years and were incredible 
mentors and advocates during their time in and after the program. 

I will never 
forget my time designing and launching this program. All of the amazing people 
I got to know and work with and how much I learned from them all.
