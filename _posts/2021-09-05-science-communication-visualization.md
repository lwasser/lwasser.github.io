## Exploring Science Communication on YouTube

My first program develop job was at [National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)](https://www.neonscience.org)
 where I was tasked with building a National (United States) program that helped
 scientists use NEON data. Given my science background in remote sensing and design
 (Landscape Architecture) combined with an obsession with several youtube 
 channels that had gotten widely successful publishing short videos that 
 translated often complex science topics, 
 I decided to build a YouTube Channel. 

 Below are the videos I created working with an incredibly talented graphics
 artist - Colin Williams who was on my team. Each video had a script that was 
 vetted by a small team of scientists for content accuracy. In the end I took
 a step away frm this part of the NEON Data Skills program given the resources it 
 took to create these videos and the relatively low return in terms of creating 
 educational content that we could use in workshops.
