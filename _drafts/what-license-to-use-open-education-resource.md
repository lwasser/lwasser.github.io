## What license should open education resources for earth and environmental data science avoid and why?

Ideally, online open education resources have an open license such as [Creative Commons Share Alike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). The Creative 
Commons SHare Alike license is a great license because
it's [copyleft](https://snyk.io/learn/what-is-copyleft-license/) like in nature. This 
means that the content is open, but it must continue to be open if it's reused
in any way.

#### No commercial licenses are not ideal even if they are creative commons 
Ideally the license on open education resources does not have a 
[no commercial clause](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/) 
attached to it.

No commercial, allows the lessons to be used by individuals. However, it's limitations
may surprise you. It 
technically prevents anyone who teaches with that license, in an 
environment where there is monetary exchange involved.

Examples of such environments include:

* paid workshops 
* college level courses where tuition is involved
* or even training events where funding supports a non profit cause

This type of restriction can potentially hurt those who may need the resources
the most. Institutions that are smaller, and serve students who have been 
traditionally under-served and underrepresented in STEM are examples of schools 
that may lose more if our open education materials have a no commercial creative 
commons license.
