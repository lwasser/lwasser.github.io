## I Love Building Programs From the Ground Up that Support Open Science

I've built two programs in the past 10 years that support open 
science. Both programs emphasized:

* **Earth & Environmental Data Science Education:** Empowering people with technical, in workforce demand skills.  
* **Open Education:** Some programs require, others ensure  as many people as possible have access to learning materials and training
* **Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Accessibility:** making sure that programs are accessible to different people with different backgrounds, globally.

## Teaching approach and philosophy

Blended Online and In-Person Classrooms, Active Learning and Teaching

Through time, I have developed a teaching framework that combines active
learning, blended online and in-person student participation and cloud based
tools that support both teaching earth data science and scaling courses to
support more students.

## Free  Open Source Software Tools For Earth Data Science and Education - FOSS

Open source refers to a (programming) tool or project where the (source) or
the code used to build the tool is available for anyone to see, use and
contribute to. If the tool is free, it will be referred to as FOSS or Free Open
Source Software. To make it easier to teach earth data science I help build
free open source software tools. Below are some of the free-to-use open source
projects that i'm currently leading.
