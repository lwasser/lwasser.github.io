  Open and reproducible workflows allow scientists to build upon each others work. 
  When scientists can reuse existing workflows, they focus more of their time 
  in developing new analyses that in turn advance 
  science more quickly. "

    While training and a summer internship were one part of the program, I believe that training alone is not enough. The program sought to empower faculty at institutions to add data intensive curriculum to their courses. The core of the program included a summer program where we provided training to faculty and students in open, reproducible earth and environmental data science skills. The program supported faculty in both learning the skills and adding it to their existing courses. "

## I design programs that support diverse groups pursuing careers in STEM 
{: .fancy-header }

Supporting groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) is core to all of the programs that I have developed. This work inspires me to do more, every day. 

To support programmatic diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility I:

* Apply adaptive, evaluation-driven program design.
* Let communities drive the program design based upon their needs. 
* Try my best to always listen and support.
* Work to empower individuals when I see motivation and interest.
* Create content that is accessibility to a broad audience.

## I development tools and build community around the open source tools that enable and drive open science
{: .fancy-header }

Free and open source software (FOSS) refers to free tools that make their code available to the public online. These free tools are critical as they drive an enable open science, by:

* simplifying scientists workflows and 
* allowing scientists to more easily build upon each other's work given the tools to run the workflows are freely available.

Over the past decade i've dedicated a significant amount of my time to learning best practices associated with using building open source tools.

And more recently I decided to dedicate my current career path to [building community around open source software](https://www.pyopensci.org/blog/new-executive-director-leah-wasser).

## Free  Open Source Software Tools For Earth Data Science and Education - FOSS

Open source refers to a (programming) tool or project where the (source) or
the code used to build the tool is available for anyone to see, use and
contribute to. If the tool is free, it will be referred to as FOSS or Free Open
Source Software. To make it easier to teach earth data science I help build
free open source software tools. Below are some of the free-to-use open source
projects that i'm currently leading.

<!-- I've built two programs in the past 10 years that support open 
science. Both programs emphasized:

* **Earth & Environmental Data Science Education:** Empowering people with technical, in workforce demand skills.  
* **Open Education:** Some programs require, others ensure  as many people as possible have access to learning materials and training
* **Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Accessibility:** making sure that programs are accessible to different people with different backgrounds, globally.

Blended Online and In-Person Classrooms, Active Learning and Teaching

Through time, I have developed a teaching framework that combines active
learning, blended online and in-person student participation and cloud based
tools that support both teaching earth data science and scaling courses to
support more students.
