These lessons utilized data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites. After several years of development at NEON, the lessons are now in the hands of an active and engaged Carpentry community to be taught by instructors across the globe and have been formally published by the Carpentries.

NEON data skills scaled training that helps the community work with and use NEON data using an online, open education learning portal. When I left NEON, the data skills portal had 12-16,000 unique global users a month and was quickly growing. The portal has since been merged with larger neonscience website."

## EarthDataScience.org Learning Portal

I designed, branded and built the earthdatascience.org learning portal. This website provided anyone with internet, access to the Earth Data Analytics 
program course materials that I developed. 

When I left this position, the portal contained over 300 lessons. It also had a global growing user base of 
over 200,000 unique visitors a month. and has over 50,000 unique global users
visit a month.

### Online Open Education - Self Paced Earth Data Science Courses

I publish earth data science course and workshop materials on the
earthdatascience.org portal to support open education. Many of the materials are
developed collaboratively with colleagues, my staff and sometimes even students.
The Earth Analytics courses below were ones that I designed and built
at the onset of creating the Earth Analytics Education Initiative at Earth Lab,
University of Colorado - Boulder.
