Open source refers to a (programming) tool or project where the (source) or
the code used to build the tool is available for anyone to see, use and
contribute to. If the tool is free, it will be referred to as FOSS or Free Open
Source Software. To make it easier to teach earth data science I help build
free open source software tools. Below are some of the free-to-use open source
projects that I am currently leading development of.


## pyOpenSci: Peer Reviewed, Documented, Tested and Discoverable Open Source Software for Science

pyOpenSci is a community modeled after rOpenSci that promotes open science
through supporting development and peer review of scientific software written in
the `Python` programming language.

I currently am organizing and leading the pyOpenSci effort with several colleagues.
In the past 2 years we have:

* Developed a robust peer review process
* Created and published a contributing guide that provides guidelines and standards for Python packages
* Created a partnership with JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software) to ensure they are citable.
* Gathered extensive community support.
* Reviewed a suite of open source python packages harnessing the power of volunteer reviewers and editors.

I am currently serving as the editor in chief but am also actively
seeking funding for this project to support hiring someone to work on this project
full time.

## Open Source Software Tools That I Am Currently Working On

I am leading the development of several free open source software tools for
`Python`. These tools have been developed collaboratively with colleagues at
Earth Lab, undergraduate interns and graduate students. `EarthPy` is used
extensively as a part of the `earth-analytics-python` open education course.
`Matplotcheck` was designed to support unit testing of plots for autograding
student assignment. It also is useful for developing unit tests in
Python packages that have plots.
