<!-- TODO: I'd like for the intro to be wider and bugger font... 
more visually interesting 
TODO:
* I want all text left aligned. it's too hard to read otherwise
* find better images for each program
* The top intro is too small text and too narrow... make it more visually interesting...
* Do something with each section to make it a bit more visually interesting
* This is a lot of HTML. would a few little loops and a YAML file be easier to maintain??
* REmove dates from body since i added the launched icon!
* Make the launch text a bit lighter grey and smaller font size too

## I Develop Programs That Support Open Science & Build Community

Building programs is incredibly fun and rewarding! Below you can learn a bit 
about the programs that I've build over the past ~10 years.

## What I'm Up To Now: 

I'm currently the Executive Director of pyOpenSci. I started working on this project 
in 2017/2018. In July 2022, supported by funds from the Alfred Sloan foundation 
I moved pyOpenSci to a fiscal sponsor. I am now Executive Director of the project 
and working to build a diverse community around Python open source software in 
support of Open Science.

                    <p>I designed a program
                    that 1) Provided training and career development in earth and environmental
                    data science to undergraduate students at several institutions 2)
                    built capacity for faculty to teach these skills at their institutions.
                    The program was supported by a 1.3 million dollar NSF award in 2019.

                materials taught at conferences around the United States and also 
                individual sets of lessons designed to support using different 
                types of data for scientific analysis. When I left NEON in 2016

                    NSF to work on a collaborative hackathon. The goal: to build capacity

                    open science workflows. Scientists applied to participate and
