<!-- TODO: I'd like for the intro to be wider and bugger font... 
more visually interesting 
TODO:
* I want all text left aligned. it's too hard to read otherwise
* find better images for each program
* The top intro is too small text and too narrow... make it more visually interesting...
* Do something with each section to make it a bit more visually interesting
* This is a lot of HTML. would a few little loops and a YAML file be easier to maintain??
* REmove dates from body since i added the launched icon!
* Make the launch text a bit lighter grey and smaller font size too

## I LOVE Developing Programs That Support Open Science & Build Community

Building programs is incredibly fun and rewarding! Below you can learn a bit 
about the programs that I've build over the past ~10 years.

                    <p>I designed a program
                    that 1) Provided training and career development in earth and environmental
                    data science to undergraduate students at several institutions 2)
                    built capacity for faculty to teach these skills at their institutions.
                    The program was supported by a 1.3 million dollar NSF award in 2019.

                    NSF to work on a collaborative hackathon. The goal: to build capacity

                    open science workflows. Scientists applied to participate and

                    expand and grow skills; managers who wanted to better understand the technical 
                    work their team was doing and finally those looking for a career change.
